Code for a caputure the flag like robot battle game!

## How to Play
### Gameplay
Goal: Spend ()s in the enemy's "Flag Zone" and return to your side. You cannot win if any enemy bot has your flag. 
This is a game played by two teams, each consisting of three bots. Any number of players can be on each team. Each team will have one of each bot type. The players' goal will be to choose the best bot strategies to capture the opponent's flag while securing their own base. There are no turns, and strategies may be swapped in and out at any time. 

### Meet the bots!
#### The Tank
#### The Entangler
#### The Ranger

### Set up
This game is designed to take place on a basketball court, with the robots, a computer, and a monitor for each team. 
Each team will have 3 robots, one of each type.
(Calibration step?)

### Rules
Offensive attacks can either **tag** or **immobilize** their opponents. Robots will automatically declare themselves **immobilized** if they are unresponsive for more than 5 seconds. An immobilized bot is permanently removed from the game. Common reasons for immobilization include being entangled or being flipped over. Only The Ranger can **tag** opponents. This is accomplished by shooting them. When a robot is tagged, they are stunned for ()s and it temporarily loses its ability to pick up or carry flags. The tagged robot must return to its home turf before it restores its ability to pick up a flag. Each team's Flag Zone is tag-free, meaning bots in the zone cannot tag, nor can they be tagged. Notably, the Flag Zone is not an immobilization-free zone. Flags that are dropped via immobilization or tag "teleport" instantly back to their home base.
